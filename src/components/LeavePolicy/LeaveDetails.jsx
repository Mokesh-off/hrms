          <h1>National holidays</h1>
          <li>
            Republic Day (January 26), Independence Day (August 15) and Gandhi
            Jayanti (October 2) are the three national holidays observed in
            India.
          </li>
          <li>
            On these days all institutions, irrespective of under which law they
            are covered, or whether they are public or private organizations or
            MNCs should necessarily remain closed.
          </li>
          <li>

            locality and are granted to the employees in accordance with the

        <p>
          <h1>Paternity leave</h1>
          <li>
            Paternity leave is paid or unpaid leave given to a male employee
            when a child is born.
          </li>
          <li>
            While paternity leave is authorised for government employees there
            is no law that instructs the private sector to make it obligatory.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hence, paternity leave is open to interpretation by individual
            companies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Thus, on the one hand you have a Cisco Systems (India) which grants
            its employees 12 weeks paternity leaves and on the other, you have
            Infosys which offers 5 days of paid leave Individual organisations
            decide whether or not they would like to extend the facility of
            Paternity Leave.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is no legal requirement in regards to granting Paternity Leave
            to anyone.
          </li>
